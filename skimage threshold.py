This code performs image segmentation with skimage
Step 1: Read image and convert image dtype to easy to calculate
Step 2: Denoising, if required 
step 3: threshold image Clean up image, if needed (erode, etc.) 
        and create a mask for image
Step 4: Label grains in the masked image
Step 5: Measure the properties of each grain (object)
Step 6: Output results into a csv file

    ndi.distance_transform_edt():
        Exact Euclidean distance transform, which gives values of the Euclidean distance:
                           n
            y_i = sqrt(sum (x[i]-b[i])**2)

    peak_ocal_max():
        Find peaks in an image as coordinate list or boolean mask.
        Peaks are the local maxima in a region of 2 * min_distance + 1 (i.e. peaks are separated by at least min_distance).
        If there are multiple local maxima with identical pixel intensities inside the region defined with min_distance, 
        the coordinates of all such pixels are returned.
   min_distance: int, optional
        Minimum number of pixels separating peaks in a region of 2 * min_distance + 1 (i.e. peaks are separated by at least 
        min_distance). To find the maximum number of peaks, use min_distance=1.
  markers: 
      int, or ndarray of int, same shape as image, optional
      The desired number of markers, or an array marking the basins with the values to be assigned in the label matrix. 
      Zero means not a marker. If None (no markers given), the local minima of the image are used as markers.
    indices:
        If indices = True : (row, column, â€¦) coordinates of peaks.
        If indices = False : Boolean array shaped like image, with peaks represented by True values.
    footprint:
        ndarray of bools, optional
        If provided, footprint == 1 represents the local region within which to search for peaks at every point in image. 
        Overrides min_distance.
    labels: 
        ndarray of ints, optional
        If provided, each unique region labels == value represents a unique region to search for peaks. 
        Zero is reserved for background.
        An integer ndarray where each unique feature in input has a unique label in the returned array.
    mask:
        ndarray of bools or 0s and 1s, optional
        Array of same shape as image. Only points at which mask == True will be labeled.
